# conlang-archivist
A tool for building naturalistic constructed languages with a focus on vocabulary and historical sound evolution.
Remembers and provides access to the language as it existed at any point in its development over (simulated) time.

Pretty functional at the moment but still under development!

Grammar is not currently supported. All this tool will keep track of at the moment is the evolution of vocabulary.
